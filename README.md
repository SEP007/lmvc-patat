# LMVC Afresh (A fresh start)

Start a fresh LMVC project by cloning this repository. It offers a basic configuration with its folder structures.

It depends on *composer* and *bower* for fetching its basic set of dependencies.

Just run `./bootstrap.sh` to run *composer*, *bower* and set `chmods` on all caching directories appropriately.

Afterwards: *Code away!*
